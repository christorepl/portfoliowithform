						<p> My name is Christopher O'Brien and I am currently training to become a software developer with the Thinkful Engineering Flex program. I am currently in the process of relocating from Brooklyn, NY to Ithaca, NY.</p>
						<p> I am a lifelong computer hobbyist who recently exited the hospitality service, and am eager to start a new career. The hospitality industry has given me lots of team building and leadership skills that will prove to be a valuable asset in the tech field.</p>

				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<div class='group'>
					<div class='item'>
						<p>The greatest joy I got from the hospitality industry was making people happy with the food I produced. As a vegan cook, I accepted making plant based meals as a form of activism. Over time I realized it wasn't activism at all, but a source of pacification for the feeling that I could be doing more to change the world. With my work as a developer, I will center goals of economic and social justice and general improvement of quality of life.</p>
					</div>
					<div class='item'>
						<p>As a programmer, I hope to provide compassionate and socially conscious services for clients. Multiple and diverse perspectives will be crucial to a successful project that tackles goals of justice, so I look forward to working with a team to make it happen. Whatever the capacity or size of contribution may be, I will be happy to help achieve those goals.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class='group'>
					<div class='item'>
						<p> One of the most attractive things about the tech industry for me is the seemingly endless number of people who want to help other people learn, and the bounty of open-source projects available to users. I think technology performs best when it is shared, affordable, and accessible. I look forward to continuing this trend as a qualified software developer.</p>
					</div>
					<div class='item'>
						<p>As a computer hobbyist, I also look forward to accruing skills that I will be able to employ in my own personal coding projects. I hope to build software, plug-ins, and other sorts of modifications for free and release them to the public. I wouldn't have the luxuries I do if it were not for people who share this mindset. </p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class='group'>
					<div class='item'>
						<p>Computers aren't my whole life! I enjoy making fermented foods such as nut based cheeses, wines and other drinkables, kimchi, saurkraut, etc. I also enjoy going on hiking trails to forage and identify plants. I'm not very good at identifying plants yet but I'm learning!</p>

						<p class='titular' class="covid">CovidPovertyLink</p>
						<ul>
							<p>The first app I was in charge of envisioning and writing on my own. A front-end app with API calls. An app for users to research and compare the COVID-19 rates and poverty rates of US states. Users can select one or more US states and view data related to poverty and COVID-19 rates.</p>

						<p class='titular'>Food Justice Now</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The first full stack app I wrote entirely on my own. This app is still a WiP and is sort of an upgrade of the previous app. It allows users to inspect racial demographics, 2020 election results, poverty, food insecurity, and COVID-19 rates. Has visual aids in the form of charts.</li>
